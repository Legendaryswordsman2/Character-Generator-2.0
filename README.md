## The Character Generator 2.0 was created to aid in the process of creating characters from Modern Interiors. It's a remake of the orignal Character Generator which had several flaws which this new Character Generator fixes.

## Guide

### –Familiarize yourself–
#### At the top of the screen are dropdowns. Each dropdown allows you to modify a different part of the character (Body, Eyes, Outfit, Etc). In the middle of the screen is the character preview where you can view your character as you're making it.

### -Tabs-
#### At the bottom of the screen are 4 tabs, each tab serves a different purpose in helping you create your character. To the sides are two buttons, the right side button allows you to save your character to your computer. The left side button is an info menu showing various information about the Character Generaator 2.0.

### -Animation Tab-
#### This is the default tab. This tab allows you to change the animation playing in the character preview. 10 animations are available to choose such as idle, walk, sit, etc. Click on any animation to start playing it on repeat.

### -Randomize Tab-
#### To the right of the window is a set of toggles. You can use these to set which parts of the character you want to be randomized. To the left of the window is a button labeled "Randomize", clicking it will randomize all parts of the character that have been toggled on.

### -History Tab-
#### This tab contains a list of the last 30 character modifications and saved characters. The default view shows your previous character edits. Every time you change any piece of your character it will be logged here. Clicking on any previous character will revert your character to that version.

#### At the bottom of the tab  you can change the view mode, the "Modifications" mode is the default mode which was previously explained. The "Saved" mode shows your last 30 saved characters.

### -Character Tab-
#### To the left of the character tab you can select the character type, the default is adult. The second option is a child. Children contain all the same character pieces an adult has except accessories.

#### To the right of the tab is the "Try Character" button. Clicking this button will transport you to a simulated world where you can test out how your character looks and feels.

### -Save Character-
#### To the right of the tabs is a button labeled "Save". Clicking this button opens a popup allowing you to save your character as a png file on your computer. Simply input the name you want for your character and it's size, then click save.

#### Once saved, you'll be shown statistics about how many characters have been created and a button will be shown which when clicked will show where your character was saved.

### -Hotkeys-
#### Various hotkeys are available to make use of the Character Generator 2.0 easier. Hotkeys include the following:

#### - Open Save Popup: 'S'
#### - Open Info Popup: 'I'
